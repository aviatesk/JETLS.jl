`ClientCapabilities` define capabilities for dynamic registration, workspace and text
document features the client supports. The `experimental` can be used to pass
experimental capabilities under development. For future compatibility a
`ClientCapabilities` object literal can have more properties set than currently defined.
Servers receiving a `ClientCapabilities` object literal with unknown properties should
ignore these properties. A missing property should be interpreted as an absence of the
capability. If a missing property normally defines sub properties, all missing sub
properties should be interpreted as an absence of the corresponding capability.

Client capabilities got introduced with version 3.0 of the protocol. They therefore
only describe capabilities that got introduced in 3.x or later. Capabilities that
existed in the 2.x version of the protocol are still mandatory for clients. Clients
cannot opt out of providing them. So even if a client omits the
`ClientCapabilities.textDocument.synchronization` it is still required that the client
provides text document synchronization (e.g. open, changed and close notifications).

The initialize request is sent as the first request from the client to the server.
If the server receives a request or notification before the initialize request it should act
as follows:
   - For a request the response should be an error with code: -32002. The message
     can be picked by the server.
   - Notifications should be dropped, except for the exit notification. This will allow
     the exit of a server without an initialize request.

Until the server has responded to the initialize request with an `InitializeResult`,
the client must not send any additional requests or notifications to the server.
In addition the server is not allowed to send any requests or notifications to the client
until it has responded with an `InitializeResult`, with the exception that during the
initialize request the server is allowed to send the notifications `window/showMessage`,
`window/logMessage` and `telemetry/event` as well as the `window/showMessageRequest`
request to the client. In case the client sets up a progress token in the initialize params
(e.g. property `workDoneToken`) the server is also allowed to use that token
(and only that token) using the `\$/progress` notification sent from the server to the
client.
The initialize request may only be sent once.
