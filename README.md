The goal of this project is to develop a new language server for
[Julia](https://julialang.org/), currently called "JETLS".
JETLS aims to enhance developer productivity by providing advanced static
analysis and seamless integration with the Julia runtime.
By leveraging tooling technologies like
[JET.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl),
[JuliaSyntax.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaSyntax.jl) and
[JuliaLowering.jl](https://github.com/c42f/JuliaLowering.jl),
JETLS aims to offer enhanced language features such as type-sensitive
diagnostics, macro-aware go-to definition and such.

This repository manages JETLS.jl, a Julia package that implements a language
server, and [`jetls-client`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aviatesk.jetls-client),
a sample VSCode extension that serves as a language client for testing JETLS.
