The goal of this project is to develop a new language server for
[Julia](https://julialang.org/), currently called "JETLS".
This language server aims to enhance developer productivity by providing
advanced static analysis and seamless integration with the Julia runtime.
By leveraging tooling technologies like
[JET.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl),
[JuliaSyntax.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaSyntax.jl) and
[JuliaLowering.jl](https://github.com/c42f/JuliaLowering.jl),
JETLS aims to offer enhanced language features such as type-sensitive
diagnostics, macro-aware go-to definition and such.

This repository manages JETLS.jl, a Julia package that implements a language
server, and jetls-client, a sample VSCode extension that serves as a language
client for testing JETLS. For information on how to use JETLS with other
frontends, please refer to the [Other editors](#other-editors) section.

## Requirements

- VSCode v1.93.0 or higher
- npm v11.0.0 or higher
- Julia [`v"1.12.0-beta2"`](https://julialang.org/downloads/#upcoming_release)
  or higher

## Steps

- Run `julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'` in this folder to
  install all necessary Julia packages.
- Run `npm install` in this folder to install all necessary node modules for
  the client.
- Open this folder in VSCode.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> to start compiling the client and server in
  [watch mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#:~:text=The%20first%20entry%20executes,the%20HelloWorld.js%20file.).
- Switch to the Run and Debug View in the Sidebar (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+D</kbd>).
- Select `Launch Client` from the drop-down menu (if it is not already selected).
- Press `â–·` to run the launch configuration (<kbd>F5</kbd>).
- In the [Extension Development Host](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension#:~:text=Then%2C%20inside%20the%20editor%2C%20press%20F5.%20This%20will%20compile%20and%20run%20the%20extension%20in%20a%20new%20Extension%20Development%20Host%20window.)
  instance of VSCode, open a Julia file.

## Roadmap
