The protocol up to now assumes one root folder which is announced to the server by the
`rootUri` property of the `InitializeParams`. If the client supports workspace folders and
announces them via the corresponding `workspaceFolders` client capability,
the `InitializeParams` contain an additional property `workspaceFolders` with the configured
workspace folders when the server starts.

The `workspace/workspaceFolders` request is sent from the server to the client to fetch the
