# LSP.jl

In this directory, the Julia version of the
[LSP specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification)
is defined.

The Julia implementation leverages custom `@interface` and `@namespace` macros
to faithfully translate the TypeScript LSP specification into idiomatic Julia code:

- **`@interface` macro**: Creates Julia structs with keyword constructors
  (`@kwdef`) that mirror TypeScript `interface`s:
  - Uses `Union{Nothing, Type} = nothing` field to represent TypeScript's optional properties (`field?: Type`)
  - Supports inheritance through `@extends` to compose interfaces (similar to TypeScript's `extends`)
  - Enables anonymous interface definitions within `Union` types for inline type specifications
  - Automatically configures `StructTypes.omitempties()` to omit optional fields during JSON serialization
  - Creates method dispatchers for `RequestMessage` and `NotificationMessage` types to enable LSP message routing

- **`@namespace` macro**: Creates Julia modules containing typed constants that correspond to TypeScript `namespace`s:
  - Defines constants with proper type annotations and documentation
  - Provides a `Ty` type alias for convenient type references: See also the [Caveats](#caveats) section

These macros create Julia types that mirror the original TypeScript interfaces
while handling type conversions, optional fields, and inheritance relationships.
This approach ensures that the Julia code maintains semantic equivalence with
the TypeScript specification while taking advantage of Julia's type system,
making the implementation both accurate and performant.

## Caveats

- **Namespace Type References**: Due to the design that mimics TypeScript
  `namespace`s using Julia's `module` system, namespace types must be referenced
  with the `.Ty` suffix (e.g., `SignatureHelpTriggerKind.Ty` below).
  This is a constraint of Julia's module scoping rules, where constants and
  type aliases within modules cannot be accessed without explicit qualification.

## Original specification
The original LSP specification is managed in [specification.md](./specification.md),
which is just Markdown file.
By passing the Markdown text of the LSP specification you want to convert
to an LLM model along with this documentation, you can request automatic
conversion to Julia LSP definitions.

## Example conversion

As an example of the conversion, it is shown below how the
"Signature Help Request" specification is converted to Julia code.
