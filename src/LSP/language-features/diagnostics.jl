The workspace diagnostic request is sent from the client to the server to ask the server to
compute workspace wide diagnostics which previously were pushed from the server to the
client. In contrast to the document diagnostic request the workspace request can be long
running and is not bound to a specific workspace or document state. If the client supports
streaming for the workspace diagnostic pull it is legal to provide a document diagnostic
report multiple times for the same document URI. The last one reported will win over previous
reports.

If a client receives a diagnostic report for a document in a workspace diagnostic request
for which the client also issues individual document diagnostic pull requests the client
needs to decide which diagnostics win and should be presented. In general:

    - diagnostics for a higher document version should win over those from a lower document
      version (e.g. note that document versions are steadily increasing)
    - diagnostics from a document pull should win over diagnostics from a workspace pull.
