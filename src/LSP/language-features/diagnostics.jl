# Publish diagnostics
# ===================

"""
Diagnostics notifications are sent from the server to the client to signal
results of validation runs.

Diagnostics are "owned" by the server so it is the server's responsibility to clear them
if necessary. The following rule is used for VS Code servers that generate diagnostics:

- if a language is single file only (for example HTML) then diagnostics are cleared by the
  server when the file is closed. Please note that open / close events don't necessarily
  reflect what the user sees in the user interface. These events are ownership events. So
  with the current version of the specification it is possible that problems are not
  cleared although the file is not visible in the user interface since the client has not
  closed the file yet.
- if a language has a project system (for example C#) diagnostics are not cleared when a
  file closes. When a project is opened all diagnostics for all files are recomputed (or
  read from a cache).

When a file changes it is the server's responsibility to re-compute diagnostics and push
them to the client. If the computed set is empty it has to push the empty array to clear
former diagnostics. Newly pushed diagnostics always replace previously pushed diagnostics.
There is no merging that happens on the client side.

# ================

"""
Diagnostics are currently published by the server to the client using a
notification. This model has the advantage that for workspace wide diagnostics
the server has the freedom to compute them at a server preferred point in
time. On the other hand the approach has the disadvantage that the server
can't prioritize the computation for the file in which the user types or
which are visible in the editor. Inferring the client's UI state from the
[`textDocument/didOpen`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didOpen)
and [`textDocument/didChange`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didChange)
notifications might lead to false positives since these notifications are
ownership transfer notifications.

The specification therefore introduces the concept of diagnostic pull requests
to give a client more control over the documents for which diagnostics should
be computed and at which point in time.

streaming for the workspace diagnostic pull it is legal to provide a document diagnostic
report multiple times for the same document URI. The last one reported will win over previous
reports.

If a client receives a diagnostic report for a document in a workspace diagnostic request
for which the client also issues individual document diagnostic pull requests the client
needs to decide which diagnostics win and should be presented. In general:

- diagnostics for a higher document version should win over those from a lower document
    version (e.g. note that document versions are steadily increasing)
- diagnostics from a document pull should win over diagnostics from a workspace pull.

# -----------------------------

"""
Generally the language server specification doesn't enforce any specific client implementation
since those usually depend on how the client UI behaves. However since diagnostics can be
provided on a document and workspace level here are some tips:

- a client should pull actively for the document the users types in.
- if the server signals inter file dependencies a client should also pull for visible documents
  to ensure accurate diagnostics. However the pull should happen less frequently.
- if the server signals workspace pull support a client should also pull for workspace
  diagnostics. It is recommended for clients to implement partial result progress for the
  workspace pull to allow servers to keep the request open for a long time. If a server closes
  a workspace diagnostic pull request the client should re-trigger the request.
