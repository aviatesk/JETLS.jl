"""
Since version 3.6.0

Many tools support more than one root folder per workspace. Examples for this are VS Code’s
multi-root support, Atom’s project folder support or Sublime’s project support. If a client
workspace consists of multiple roots then a server typically needs to know about this.
The protocol up to now assumes one root folder which is announced to the server by the
`rootUri` property of the `InitializeParams`. If the client supports workspace folders and
announces them via the corresponding `workspaceFolders` client capability,
the `InitializeParams` contain an additional property `workspaceFolders` with the configured
workspace folders when the server starts.

The `workspace/workspaceFolders` request is sent from the server to the client to fetch the
current open list of workspace folders.
Returns null in the response if only a single file is open in the tool.
Returns an empty array if a workspace is open but no folders are configured.
