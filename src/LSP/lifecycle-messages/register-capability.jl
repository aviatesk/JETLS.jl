The `client/registerCapability` request is sent from the server to the client to register
for a new capability on the client side. Not all clients need to support dynamic
capability registration. A client opts in via the `dynamicRegistration` property on the
specific client capabilities. A client can even provide dynamic registration for
capability A but not for capability B (see `TextDocumentClientCapabilities` as an
example).

Server must not register the same capability both statically through the initialize
result and dynamically for the same document selector. If a server wants to support
both static and dynamic registration it needs to check the client capability in the
initialize request and only register the capability statically if the client doesn't
support dynamic registration for that capability.
