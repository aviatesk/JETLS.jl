# Formatting

JETLS provides document formatting support through integration with external
formatting tools. By default, [Runic.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Runic.jl)
is used, but you can configure alternative formatters or use custom formatting
executables.

## Features

- **Document formatting**: Format entire Julia files
- **Range formatting**: Format selected code regions (Runic and custom
  formatters only)
- **Progress notifications**: Visual feedback during formatting operations
  for clients that support work done progress

## Prerequisites

JETLS supports preset formatters as well as custom formatting executables.
For preset formatters, install your preferred formatter and ensure it's
available in your system `PATH`:

- [Runic](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Runic.jl) (default):
  ```bash
  julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.Apps.add("Runic")'
  ```

- [JuliaFormatter](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl)
  (requires [v2.2.0](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl/releases/tag/v2.2.0) or higher):
  ```bash
  julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.Apps.add("JuliaFormatter")'
  ```

Note that you need to manually make `~/.julia/bin` available on the `PATH`
environment for the formatter executables to be accessible.
See <https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/apps/> for the details.

For custom formatters, no installation is requiredâ€”simply configure the path
to your executable in `.JETLSConfig.toml` (see the
[custom formatter](#custom-formatter) section below).

## Formatter configuration

Configure the formatter using either a `.JETLSConfig.toml` file in your project
root or via LSP configuration (see [How to configure JETLS](@ref) for details).
The configuration supports three options:

### Preset `"Runic"` (default)

```toml
formatter = "Runic"
```

In this case, JETLS will look for the `runic` executable and use it to perform
formatting.

This is the default setting and doesn't require explicit configuration.
Runic supports both document and range formatting.

### Preset `"JuliaFormatter"`

```toml
formatter = "JuliaFormatter"
```

In this case, JETLS will look for the `jlfmt` executable and use it to perform
formatting.

If a [`.JuliaFormatter.toml` configuration](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/config/)
file is found in your project, `jlfmt` will use those settings.
Otherwise, it uses default settings with formatting options provided by the
editor client (such as tab size) when available.

!!! warning
    Note that JuliaFormatter currently, as of v2.2.0, only supports full
    document formatting, not range formatting.

### Custom formatter

```toml
[formatter.custom]
executable = "/path/to/custom-formatter"
executable_range = "/path/to/custom-range-formatter"
```

Custom formatters should accept Julia code via stdin and output formatted
code to stdout, following the same interface as `runic`:

- `executable`: Command for full document formatting. The formatter should
  read the entire Julia source code from stdin, format it completely, and
  write the formatted result to stdout. The exit code should be 0 on success.
- `executable_range`: Command for range formatting. The formatter should
  accept a `--lines=START:END` argument to format only the specified line
  range. It should read the entire document code from stdin and write the
  _entire document code_ to stdout with only the specified region formatted.
  The rest of the document must remain unchanged.

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error about the formatter not being found:

1. Ensure you've installed the formatter as described above
2. Check that the formatter executable is in your system `PATH` by running
   `which runic` or `which jlfmt`
3. For custom formatters, verify the executable path specified in your settings
4. Restart your editor to ensure it picks up the updated `PATH` or configuration
