# TestRunner integration

JETLS integrates with [TestRunner.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/TestRunner.jl)
to provide an enhanced testing experience directly within your editor. This
feature allows you to run individual `@testset` blocks directly from your
development environment.

## Prerequisites

To use this feature, you need to install the `testrunner` executable:
```bash
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.Apps.add(url="https://github.com/aviatesk/TestRunner.jl")'
```

Note that you need to manually make `~/.julia/bin` available on the `PATH`
environment for the `testrunner` executable to be accessible.
See <https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/apps/> for the details.

## Features

### Code lens

When you open a Julia file containing `@testset` blocks, JETLS displays
interactive code lenses above each `@testset`:

> - `▶ Run "testset_name"`: Run the testset for the first time
> ```@raw html
> <img class="display-light-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-lens.png" alt="TestRunner Code Lens"/>
> <img class="display-dark-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-lens-dark.png" alt="TestRunner Code Lens"/>
> ```

After running tests, the code lens is refreshed as follows:
> - `▶ Rerun "testset_name" [summary]`: Re-run a testset that has previous results
> - `☰ Open logs`: View the detailed test output in a new editor tab
> - `✓ Clear result`: Remove the test results and inline diagnostics
> ```@raw html
> <img class="display-light-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-lens-refreshed.png" alt="TestRunner Code Lens with Results"/>
> <img class="display-dark-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-lens-refreshed-dark.png" alt="TestRunner Code Lens with Results"/>
> ```

### Code actions

You can trigger test runs via "code actions" that are explicitly requested by the user:

> - Inside a `@testset` block: Run the entire testset
> ```@raw html
> <img class="display-light-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-actions.png" alt="TestRunner Code Actions"/>
> <img class="display-dark-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-actions-dark.png" alt="TestRunner Code Actions"/>
> ```

> - On an individual `@test` macro: Run just that specific test case
> ```@raw html
> <img class="display-light-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-actions-test-case.png" alt="TestRunner Code Actions @test case"/>
> <img class="display-dark-only" src="../assets/testrunner-code-actions-test-case-dark.png" alt="TestRunner Code Actions @test case"/>
> ```

Note that when running individual `@test` cases, the error results are displayed
as temporary diagnostics for 10 seconds. Click `☰ Open logs` button in the
pop up message to view detailed error messages that persist.

### Test diagnostics

Failed tests are displayed as diagnostics (red squiggly lines) at the exact
lines where the failures occurred, making it easy to identify and fix issues:
> ```@raw html
> <img class="display-light-only" src="../assets/testrunner-diagnostics.png" alt="TestRunner Diagnostics"/>
> <img class="display-dark-only" src="../assets/testrunner-diagnostics-dark.png" alt="TestRunner Diagnostics"/>
> ```

### Progress notifications

For clients that support work done progress, JETLS shows progress notifications
while tests are running, keeping you informed about long-running test suites.

## Supported patterns

The TestRunner integration supports:

1. Named `@testset` blocks (via code lens or code actions):
   ```julia
   using Test

   # supported: named `@testset`
   @testset "foo" begin
     @test sin(0) == 0
     @test sin(Inf) == 0
     @test_throws ErrorException sin(Inf) == 0
     @test cos(π) == -1

       # supported: nested named `@testset`
       @testset "bar" begin
         @test sin(π) == 0
         @test sin(0) == 1
         @test cos(Inf) == -1
       end
   end

   # unsupported: `@testset` inside function definition
   function test_func1()
     @testset "inside function" begin
       @test true
     end
   end

   # supported: this pattern is fine
   function test_func2()
     @testset "inside function" begin
       @test true
     end
   end
   @testset "test_func2" test_func2()
   ```

2. Individual `@test` macros (via code actions only):
   ```julia
   # Run individual tests directly
   @test 1 + 1 == 2
   @test sqrt(4) ≈ 2.0

   # Also works inside testsets
   @testset "math tests" begin
     @test sin(0) == 0  # Can run just this test
     @test cos(π) == -1  # Or just this one
   end

   # Multi-line `@test` expressions are just fine
   @test begin
     x = complex_calculation()
     validate(x)
   end

   # Other Test.jl macros are supported too
   @test_throws DomainErrors sin(Inf)
   ```

See the [TestRunner.jl README](https://github.com/aviatesk/TestRunner.jl) for more details.

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error about `testrunner` not being found:

1. Ensure you've installed TestRunner.jl as described above
2. Check that `testrunner` is in your system `PATH` by running
   `which testrunner`: otherwise you may need to add `~/.julia/bin` to `PATH`
3. Restart your editor to ensure it picks up the updated `PATH`

Test execution requires that your file is saved and matches the on-disk version.
If you see a message asking you to save the file first, make sure to save your
changes before running tests.
